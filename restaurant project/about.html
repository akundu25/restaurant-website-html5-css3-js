                <h1>About</h1>
                 
                <p>Adare restaurant, the crown jewel of Savourites Hospitality Pvt Ltd is a class apart when it comes to fine dining.</p>

                <p>The journey started in 2003, at a time when the city did not boast a single stand-alone eatery serving exclusive Bengali cuisine. The gateway to the culinary delights of Bengal opened once 6 Ballygunge Place happened.</p>

                <p>Housed in the bungalow of a former Rai Bahadur, steeped in an aura of tradition and heritage, 6 Ballygunge Place changed the gastronomic landscape of the city with its curated menu. From the earliest Bengali cookbook of Pragya Sundari Devi to references from Vaishnav literature, all available resources were researched under the able guidance of Chef Sushanta Sengupta which then found its way to our elaborate spread.</p>

                <p>The rest as they say is history.</p>
